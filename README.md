# mume
some jscripts for mume (http://mume.org)

read the file on how to use it

the jscript part goes into /jmc/settings/commonlib.scr

if you dont have this file, create a text document, paste everything there and
rename file to commonlib.scr, make sure the file ending isnt .txt like this:
>control panel-> folder options -> view -> uncheck "hide extensiosn for known file types"

remove .txt from file if its there.
